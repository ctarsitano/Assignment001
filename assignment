#I conducted a scatterplot using basic plot and ggplot on the variables cost for attendance and median debt of graduate. While I saw some variability, I did notice a positive correlation as the cost of the institution increased, so did the median of debt of the individual. This would make sense as the cost would increase, one might expect someone to incurr more debt if not able to pay to the cost.

# 4 now provide separate plots for cost and debt by control of the institution
#below, I have created 3 different scatterplots on the control of the institution (1,2,3) by debt and cost. 1=public, 2= private non-profit, 3=private for-profit
#an increase in both cost and debt are noticed for public and private; yet in for profit institutions, there doesn't appear to be a relationship between cost and debt.
